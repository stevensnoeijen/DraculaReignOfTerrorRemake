Use https://free-tex-packer.com/ for packing images (cli is very slow, there is a new issue to gulp this).

After packing run `npm run add-animations-to-unit-spritesheet` to add animations to the json file(s).
After that probably should update the `npm run generate-animation-models` to update the animation-models file.
